# TeaJS
My own implementation of ECMAScript and maybe the JSAPI.
This is a rewrite of my old engine (my personal one)

When writing this, there were a few limitations:
- Must not use regex (requirement from my old engine, probably isn't nessesary but I'll keep it anyways)
- Must not use boost (quite convenient yes, but huge bloat, and I can't have that)
